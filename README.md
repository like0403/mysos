# Apache Cotton Repository Has Moved

Apache Cotton, previous named Mysos, is now an [Apache incubator project](http://incubator.apache.org/projects/cotton.html), and we've moved the codebase to ASF.

Please check out the source code from Apache's git repostory:

    git clone https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-cotton.git

or if you prefer GitHub, use the [GitHub mirror](https://github.com/apache/incubator-cotton):

    git clone https://github.com/apache/incubator-cotton.git

For issue tracking and patches, we use Apache-maintained infrastructure including the [JIRA issue tracker](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/COTTON) instead of the GitHub one, and [review board](https://reviews.apache.org/groups/cotton/) for patches instead of pull requests.

We'll update the [new Cotton homepage](http://cotton.incubator.apache.org) soon for other information including documentation and a getting started guide, etc.

Thanks!
